syntax - it is basically about the grammatical correctness of the sentence 
semantics - it is about the meaning of the sentence i.e. whether it has a valid meaning or not
lexical analyzer - produces toxens
i would be having the toxens which would be produced by the lexical analyzer
then we would be having the symbol table wherein the information for each variable would be fetch and the ir code would be thus generated

workflow :
character stream--lexical analyzer-->token stream--syntax analyzer-->
syntax tree--semantic analyzer-->ast--ir code--> ir code 


now for the interpreter i need to have 
1. grammar - combines the ebnf and the rational expression grammar
2.
