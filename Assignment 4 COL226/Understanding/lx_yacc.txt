.lex file --> used to define the interface for the lexical analyzer or the scanner
.grm / .yacc --> defines the parsing function by specifying the ml-yacc rules



ml lex specifications :-
user declarations :- we declare the values and functions associated with the program
		     important to define atleast two values -> lexresult and eof
		     lexresult -> defines the type of payload for every rule action
		     eof -> called when the lexer reaches the end of input stream

user definitions  :- we define things like identifiers, start states etc...
		     we basically kind of define a set of start states
		     a particular start state directs the lexer to enter a particular set of rules and not the other ones

rules :- each rule has two parts the regex and the action
	 regex defines the word class that a rule matches
	 action is a program fragment to be executed when a rule matches the input
	 all actions must return values of the same type



The value yypos contains the position of the first character of yytext, relative to the beginning of
the file.
